# Warrior-of-Light
Unit 1 project for General Assembly of DC

Overview

This is a small combat game with multiple options of interaction with an enemy controlled by the computer. As you defeat each enemy, the next will appear stronger than the last until you defeat the final enemy, in which case the 'win state' will trigger and congratulate the player.
